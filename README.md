# Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-Xrays-using-Deep-Learning-and-CNN

This is a Deep Learning project based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) used to detect if a person has pneumonia or not based on his/her chest X-ray images.
The dataset used for implementation of this project is taken from Kaggle.It contains 3 directories namely - training, testing and validation.
## Link to dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
## Steps of implementation include:
1) Importing Required libraries and packages
2) Data Preprocessing
3) Data Modelling and CNN Implementation
4) Evaluation of Model
5) Creating GUI-based Website
